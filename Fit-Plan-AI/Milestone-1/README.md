# Milestone 1 – FitPlan AI: Personalized Fitness Plan Generator

## Objective of the Milestone
The objective of this milestone is to build a basic web application using Streamlit that collects user fitness information and calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) along with the standard health category. This forms the foundation for future AI-based fitness plan generation.

## BMI Formula

BMI is calculated using the following formula:

BMI = weight (kg) / (height in meters)²

Height is first converted from centimeters to meters.
